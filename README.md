## Non-Functional Requirements (NFR) Guidelines

This repository contains a document that provides guidelines to Business Analysts regarding how to capture Non-Functional Requirements during the requirements gathering phase.
The guideline document provides the following:
 - Provide a list and definition of commonly used Non-Functional Requirements (NFR)
 - Questions that could be considered while eliciting the requirements for these NFR.
 - Sample requirements that can be stated as “specifications” that can be leveraged while eliciting requirements
 - Guidelines on how to validate and use the non functional requirements in a project
The list provided in this document can be revised based on specific project needs and additional Non-Functional Requirements can be added to the list as needed. The Non-Functional Requirements listed in this document, must align with the Requirements Management Plan created for the project in which the Business Analyst is engaged.

## Objective

Non-Functional Requirements are gathered from the business and technical users and these compliment the functional requirements for the solution. Often these requirements are overlooked until the later stages of the project. This may lead to missed requirements which can result in a negative experience for the end user. In addition, missed Non-Functional Requirements can result in un-foreseen defects, which can cause high incidents volumes. Therefore, it is very important that the requirements gathering team pays special attention in the elicitation of the non-functional requirements for the project.

## Intended Audience

This document is intended for both new and experienced Business Analysts and Business Architects, who are being on-boarded, in order to provide an understanding of non-functional requirements as well as provide a list of non-functional requirements which can be used as a point of reference when eliciting requirements during requirements gathering and/or design in a project.

## How to Use this Document

This document provides guidelines as well as boilerplate requirements to enable an Information Technology (IT) Business Analyst to elicit Non-Functional Requirements. However, what requirements are applicable will depend on the nature of the project (all requirements may not be applicable). Also, please note that although the document contains a comprehensive list of Non-Functional Requirements, the list may not be exhaustive. Thus, the IT Business Analyst will need to adapt the list according to the needs of the project.
